        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, one of hundreds of billions in the observable universe. It's also our home. Like other galaxies, the Milky Way is an isolated collection of stars and other material bound together by their common gravity. In addition to the 100 billion to 400 billion stars in our galaxy, a similar number of planets likely exist in the Milky Way â€” some of them part of solar systems and some floating freely. Between the stars sit innumerable nebulas, which are clouds of gas and dust. The vast majority of the interstellar gas is hydrogen and helium.</p>

        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 100,000 to 120,000 light-years</li>
            <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approximately 25,000 to 28,000 light-years.</li>
            <li><strong>Orbit Period:</strong> About 225 to 250 million years.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> About 225-250 million years</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Surface Features</h2>
        <p><li><b> Arms:</b> The Milky Way has spiral arms, including the Sagittarius Arm, the Perseus Arm, and others. These arms are regions of higher star density.</li>
           <li><b>Galactic Center:</b> At the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. </li> 
            
           <li><b> Halo: </b> Surrounding the central disk of the Milky Way is a halo of globular clusters, dark matter, and more.</li>
            
           <li><b> Interstellar Medium:</b> The space between stars contains gas, dust, and other materials collectively known as the interstellar medium. </li>
            
            <li><b> Open and Globular Clusters:</b> These are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound.</p> </li>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p><li><b>Fact 1:</b> The Milky Way was born about 12.5 billion years ago and has been growing ever since.</li>
           <li><b>Fact 2:</b> According to scientists, about 7 new stars are born in the galaxy every single year.</li>
           <li><b>Fact 3:</b> The distance of the solar system from the galactic center is about 30,000 light-years and about 20 light years from the plane of the galaxy.</li>
           <li><b>Fact 4:</b> The Milky Way travels through space at a speed of about 343 miles per second with regard to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. </li>
