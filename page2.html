        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>There are many planetary systems in the universe, with planets orbiting host stars. Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."</p>

        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Formation:</b>The Solar System formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust.</li>
            <li><b>Central Star:</b> The Sun is the central star of the Solar System, containing more than 99.8% of the total mass.</li>
            <li><b>Planets:</b>There are eight recognized planets in the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</li>
            <li><b>Dwarf Planets:</b> Pluto, once considered the ninth planet, is now classified as a dwarf planet. Other recognized dwarf planets include Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.</li>
            <li><b>Moons:</b>There are more than 200 natural moons in the Solar System, with Jupiter and Saturn having the most.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>  <ul>
            <li><b>The sun is huge:</b>If you combined the mass of everything in the solar system, the sun would account for more than 99 percent of that mass.</li>
            <li><b> Mercury is shrinking:</b>Like Earth, Mercury experiences tectonic activity. Pictures taken of the planet have indicated that the surface is changing.</li>
            <li><b>Jupiter is massive:</b>It’s large enough to fit all the rest of the planets inside it. Or put another way: It would take 1300 Earths to fill up the inside of Jupiter.</li>
            <li><b>Space junk is a big problem:</b>Between meteoroids and debris created by humans, NASA knows of over 20,000 pieces of "space junk" bigger than a softball orbiting the Earth.</li>
